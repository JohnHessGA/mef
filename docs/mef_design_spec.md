# MEF Design Spec

Version: 2026-04-19
Companion doc: `docs/README_mef.md` (build specification, scope, UX)

This document is the **technical** view of MEF: components, data model, pipeline, scoring, LLM policy, and MEFDB schema. The README is the source of truth for scope and user experience; this spec is the source of truth for architecture.

---

## 1. Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals

- Produce two daily emails (pre-market, post-market) containing high-conviction new ideas and up-to-date guidance on active recommendations + tracked positions.
- Track every recommendation MEF has ever emitted through a small, auditable lifecycle.
- Score closed recommendations against a consistent win / loss / timeout rule plus an estimated 100-share P&L.
- Ship the daily loop end-to-end as quickly as possible, even if v1's ranker is shallow and the LLM prompt is unrefined.
- Stay well below the complexity of DAS. MEF is deliberately a narrower, faster-to-ship tool.

### Non-goals (v1)

- Broad-market screening.
- DAS integration.
- RSE integration.
- Backtesting.
- Broker integration, live trade automation, execution logic.
- Non-equity asset classes.
- A web UI (may come later).
- Any notification channel beyond the two scheduled emails.

---

## 2. Architecture

MEF is a **top-level application stream**, peer to IRA Guard, consuming the AFT foundation.

```
  SHDB ──────────────────┐
  (curated market data)  │
                         ▼
  Fidelity Positions ──► MEF ──► MEFDB (mef.*)
  CSV (daily)            │         │
                         ▼         ▼
                   Claude CLI   Overwatch (ow.mef_run / ow.mef_event)
                   (LLM review)    │
                         │         ▼
                         ▼      MDC notify.py ──► 2 daily emails
```

Reads:
- **SHDB** — primary data source for all evidence.
- **Fidelity Positions CSV** — user's real holdings (same file format as IRA Guard).

Writes:
- **MEFDB** — all MEF state.
- **Overwatch** — telemetry (fail-silent).

Calls:
- **Claude CLI** (`claude -p`) for the LLM review step (pluggable — see §11).
- **MDC notify.py** for the two daily emails.

MEF writes nothing back to SHDB, RSDB, PHDB, DASDB, or MASD.

---

## 3. Components

Conceptual modules (concrete module layout lives with the code):

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `config` | Load `config/mef.yaml` + `config/postgres.yaml`, expose typed settings |
| `db` | MEFDB connection pool, migrations, repositories |
| `universe` | Load/sync universe from notes files; expose in-memory universe object |
| `shdb_reader` | Read-only SHDB queries for every evidence family |
| `import` | Ingest Fidelity Positions CSV → `position_snapshot` + `import_batch` |
| `evidence` | Compute per-symbol features from SHDB data |
| `ranker` | Deterministic scoring + directional posture + draft entry/exit plans |
| `llm` | Pluggable LLM client (Claude CLI default), prompt assembly, `llm_trace` logging |
| `recommendations` | Lifecycle state machine, active-position inference, dismissal, expiration, close detection |
| `scoring` | Compute win/loss/timeout + estimated 100-share P&L + benchmark comparisons |
| `price_check` | Post-emission yfinance "now" quote on the ~5–10 emitted ideas; annotates the email with a freshness tier. Informational only — never changes conviction or plan. See `mef_price_check.md`. |
| `email` | Render pre-market / post-market email bodies; hand to `notify.py` |
| `cli` | argparse entry points for every `mef` subcommand |
| `telemetry` | Fail-silent writes to `ow.mef_run` / `ow.mef_event` |

Composition over inheritance; no base-class hierarchies. Evidence, LLM provider, and notification sender are all swappable via config.

---

## 4. Data Sources

### 4.1 SHDB

Every evidence family in v1 must resolve to SHDB tables that already exist. Initial mapping:

| Evidence family | SHDB source |
|---|---|
| Price + volume behavior | `shdb.stock_price_1d`, `shdb.mart.stock_equity_daily`, `shdb.mart.stock_etf_daily` |
| Returns | `shdb.stock_returns_1d` |
| Momentum, trend, volatility | `shdb.stock_technicals_1d` |
| Options context | `shdb.options_snapshot_1d`, `shdb.mart.stock_options_underlying_daily`, `shdb.mart.stock_options_contract_daily` |
| Symbol reference | `shdb.symbol_master` |
| Benchmark-relative | SPY + sector ETF rows in the same price/returns/technicals tables |
| Earnings proximity | whichever SHDB earnings-calendar table is present (confirm during implementation) |

If any evidence family in the MEF overview doc does not have SHDB coverage (e.g., congressional trading, whale activity, certain sentiment overlays), it is **deferred**, not stubbed. The design spec's evidence list equals what is actually wired.

### 4.2 Fidelity Positions CSV

Same file the user already downloads for IRA Guard. MEF accepts an arbitrary path via `mef import-positions <csv>` and writes an `import_batch` + a set of `position_snapshot` rows. No sharing of PHDB tables in v1 — MEF maintains its own copy (simpler than a cross-database read; can be revisited).

### 4.3 Benchmarks

`SPY` + the seven sector ETFs (XLK/XLF/XLV/XLE/XLI/XLY/XLP) are already in the 15-ETF universe. All benchmark series are **joined from SHDB at read time**. If this causes a measurable slowdown, we cache a narrow `mef.benchmark_snapshot` daily; do not build the cache up front.

---

## 5. Daily Run Pipeline

```
mef run --when {premarket|postmarket}

  0. Acquire run lock (PID file + ow.mef_lock row, fail-fast on stale lock)
  1. Open daily_run row (status=running, when, intent)
  2. Load universe from mef.universe_stock + mef.universe_etf
  3. For each symbol, pull evidence from SHDB (parallelize; see §12)
  4. Compute features + directional posture → one candidate row per symbol
  5. Rank candidates; select top-N per side subject to thresholds
  6. Draft entry/exit/invalidation plan for each survivor
  7. LLM final review over survivors (Claude CLI, logged to llm_trace)
  8. Finalize new-ideas list (can be empty)
  9. Re-evaluate active recommendations + tracked positions:
       - re-score evidence for each
       - check invalidation / time-exit / target triggers
       - write recommendation_update rows for changes
       - transition lifecycle states where warranted
 10. Persist all outputs; close daily_run (status=ok|failed, timings)
 11. Render email body (new ideas + active updates + scoring footer)
 12. Hand off to notify.py --source MEF
 13. Write ow.mef_run success/failure; release lock
```

Pre-market and post-market runs share the pipeline; the only difference is the `intent` label on `daily_run` (`today_after_10am` vs `next_trading_day`) and whichever is the freshest available market data at run time. Cron schedule (tentative, America/New_York):

- **Pre-market:** ~07:00 ET, Mon–Fri
- **Post-market:** ~17:30 ET, Mon–Fri

Both times finalized during implementation; they must sit after the daily SHDB refresh that feeds them.

---

## 6. Evidence & Ranker

### 6.1 v1 evidence set

Pulled per universe symbol from `mart.stock_equity_daily` and
`mart.stock_etf_daily` by `src/mef/evidence.py :: pull_latest_evidence`.
The latest-bar-per-symbol fetch uses a CTE with `MAX(bar_date)` per
symbol because the obvious `DISTINCT ON … WHERE symbol = ANY(%s)`
pattern silently returns stale rows against TimescaleDB-chunked tables
when the universe array is large (fixed 2026-04-20).

**Trend posture** — `close`, `sma_20`, `sma_50`, `sma_200`,
`trend_above_sma50`, `trend_above_sma200`, plus `sma_20_slope` and
`sma_50_slope` (for chop detection and trend-direction signal).

**Multi-timeframe returns** — `return_5d`, `return_20d`, `return_63d`,
`return_126d`, `return_252d` (for the multi-timeframe consensus rule;
`return_5d` is also the short-term direction brake).

**Oscillators** — `rsi_14`, `macd_histogram`.

**Volatility** — `realized_vol_20d`, `realized_vol_63d`, `bb_width`,
`atr_14`. Used for the vol-contraction signal (ratio of 20d to 63d)
and for sizing pullback entry zones (`close − 2·ATR`).

**Position vs. peak** — `drawdown_current` (distance from 252d high).
Anchors the `needs_pullback` flag at `drawdown > -0.03`.

**Volume** — `volume_z_score`.

**Relative strength (equities only)** — `rs_vs_spy_20d`,
`rs_vs_spy_63d`, `rs_vs_qqq_63d`. Combined with sector-ETF 63d returns
(extracted from the ETF bundle) to compute sector-relative strength via
the `SECTOR_TO_ETF` map.

**Fundamental sanity (equities only)** — `pe_trailing`,
`free_cash_flow`, `earnings_yield`. ETFs have these as NULL and fall
through the fundamental rule untouched.

**Sector** — used only for the sector-relative lookup.

**Event-date context** — stocks carry `next_earnings_date` from
`shdb.earnings_calendar_upcoming` (FMP, 99.3% universe coverage).
Bundle-level `baseline["upcoming_high_impact_events"]` lists US
High-impact macro releases (CPI, NFP, FOMC, retail sales) within
3 days of `as_of_date`, pulled from `shdb.economic_calendar`. See
`mef_out_of_scope.md` for the event-date families that were
considered and deliberately excluded (ex-dividends, FOMC as a
dedicated signal, news-volume overlays, options expiration,
post-earnings drift).

The evidence module also produces a `baseline` dict on the bundle:
SPY's 20d/63d returns (legacy; ranker now reads `rs_vs_spy_*` columns
directly) and a `sector_returns_63d` map keyed by sector ETF symbol,
built from the ETF universe pull itself — no extra query.

### 6.2 Ranker — three-engine ensemble

As of 2026-04-21, MEF runs three independent deterministic engines per
run. Each produces its own top-N. The three top-Ns dedup into a
unique-by-symbol list that goes to a single LLM call, which returns
per-candidate dispositions AND a synthesis ordering for the actionable
email section.

**Engines:**

| Engine | Philosophy | Module | Postures it emits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `trend` | Continuation / breakout. Rewards above-SMAs, rising slopes, coiled-near-SMA50, sector leadership. | `_rank_trend` → `_score_symbol` | `bullish`, `range_bound` |
| `mean_reversion` | Oversold bounce. RSI < 40, 5-15% below SMA50, `return_5d ≥ 0`. Hard vetos falling knives. | `_rank_mean_reversion` → `_score_mean_rev` | `oversold_bouncing` |
| `value` | Cheap + durable. Low PE, positive FCF, modest-positive 252d trend. Equities-only. Penalizes momentum-extended names. | `_rank_value` → `_score_value` | `value_quality` |

All three share a common return type (`RankedCandidate`) that carries
an `engine` field set by the registry. Gating is no longer duplicated
across engines — as of 2026-04-21 MEF uses a three-layer model:

1. **Layer A — eligibility** (`mef.eligibility`). Per-engine earnings
   blackout windows (trend 5d, mean_rev 10d, value 10d) plus data
   presence. Universal — same set of hard exclusions applied before any
   engine scores.
2. **Layer C — per-engine thesis** (each `_score_*` function). Pure
   signal math. Produces `raw_conviction` + `posture`. The value
   engine owns the FCF hard veto here because FCF is the value thesis,
   not a universal risk control.
3. **Layer B — hazard overlay** (`mef.hazard_overlay`). Penalty-only
   adjustments for macro events and earnings-proximity (trend only).
   Produces `final_conviction = max(0, raw - hazard_total)`.

See `docs/mef_layered_gating.md` for the full layered model. That
document is the single source of truth; this section summarizes for
context but defers to it on specifics.

**Per-run flow:**

1. `rank(evidence)` iterates every registered engine, returns a
   conviction-sorted flat list tagged with `engine`.
2. `select_per_engine(candidates, threshold, top_n_per_engine)` returns
   `{engine: top-N}`. Each engine has its own threshold (default shared
   `conviction_threshold`) and its own top-N cap (`top_n_per_engine`
   config knob, default 3).
3. `merge_for_llm(per_engine)` dedups by symbol (keeping the highest-
   conviction variant across engines) and returns:
   - `unique_candidates`: list for the LLM prompt.
   - `engine_scores`: `{symbol: {engine: conviction}}` so the prompt
     can annotate per-engine agreement/disagreement.
4. LLM gate runs once — see §10 and `mef_llm_gate.md`. Gate returns
   per-candidate disposition (`approve` / `review` / `reject` /
   `unavailable`) plus structured rationale (`summary`, `strengths[]`,
   `concerns[]`, `key_judgment`). No cross-candidate ordering: each
   candidate is judged independently.
5. `_insert_recommendations` creates one rec per approved/review/
   unavailable symbol with `source_engines` populated (every engine
   that picked the symbol, not just the highest-conviction one).
6. Every engine's candidate row for the emitted symbol is marked
   `emitted = TRUE` so audit can attribute outcomes per engine.

**Why three distinct engines vs. one ranker with more signals:**
every single-philosophy scorer has structural blind spots. A
trend-follower will never surface oversold bounces; a mean-reverter
will never surface breakouts. Three independent scorers with
different philosophies surface non-overlapping picks — in the
2026-04-21 dry-run, trend (JCI/TJX/ACGL), mean-reversion
(PSX/SYY/TMUS), and value (TGT/MRK/PFE) had *zero* symbol overlap.

**Per-engine scoring rules** (trend, unchanged from pre-ensemble work):

**Return type.** Per symbol, emits a `RankedCandidate` with:
- `posture` — `bullish` / `bearish_caution` / `range_bound` / `no_edge`
- `conviction_score` — float in [0, 1]
- `needs_pullback` — boolean; flags candidates at/near their recent
  peak so `_draft_plan` anchors the entry zone to a pullback target
  (higher of `sma_20`, `close − 2·ATR`, `close·0.93`, capped ≥2% below
  close) instead of buying at the current print. Email surfaces this
  with a "⏳ wait for pullback" annotation.
- draft plan: expression, entry zone, stop, target, time-exit

**Sorting / emission.** Sort candidates by `conviction_score` desc.
Apply `conviction_threshold` (config) plus per-engine `top_n_per_engine`
cap, then deduplicate by symbol. Effective ceiling to the LLM gate is
`top_n_per_engine × N engines` = 3 × 3 = 9 candidates per run.
"No new trades today" is the intended output on weak days.

**Scoring rules** (current — will iterate). Each rule adjusts `base`
additively on top of the posture's starting value.

Posture determination (from trend flags):
- Above both SMAs → `bullish` starting base `0.55`
- Above both SMAs AND both slopes near-flat (`|slope| / close <
  0.08%/day`) → flip to `range_bound` base `0.40` ("chop above support")
- Above both SMAs AND `RSI > 70` → flip to `range_bound` base `0.45`
- Below both SMAs → `bearish_caution` base `0.45`
- Mixed SMA trend → `range_bound` base `0.40`

Bullish-branch bonuses / penalties (many also apply when the bullish
path flipped to `range_bound` mid-scoring):

| Rule                                      | Δ base |
|-------------------------------------------|-------:|
| `sma_20_slope > 0`                         | +0.03  |
| `sma_20_slope` clearly negative            | -0.05  |
| RSI 45–65 ("healthy")                      | +0.10  |
| MACD histogram > 0                         | +0.05  |
| `return_20d` in [2%, 8%] (modest)          | +0.05  |
| `return_20d > 15%` (extended bounce)       | -0.10  |
| `volume_z_score > 0.5`                     | +0.03  |
| `close` ≤3% above SMA50 (coiled)           | +0.05  |
| `close` >8% above SMA50 (extended)         | -0.08  |
| `rs_vs_spy_20d > 0`                        | +0.03  |
| `rs_vs_spy_20d < -3%`                      | -0.04  |
| `rs_vs_spy_63d > 3%` (sustained)           | +0.02  |
| `rs_vs_qqq_63d > 3%`                       | +0.02  |
| `rs_vs_qqq_63d < -8%`                      | -0.02  |
| Sector-relative 63d > 2%                    | +0.04  |
| Sector-relative 63d < -5%                   | -0.03  |

Cross-posture signals (apply to bullish + range_bound):

| Rule                                                            | Δ base |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------:|
| `realized_vol_20d / realized_vol_63d < 0.80` (vol contraction)   | +0.04  |
| Ratio > 1.30 (vol expansion)                                     | -0.03  |
| **Multi-timeframe consensus** — count "strong disagreements": `return_20d < -5%`, `return_63d < -10%`, `return_126d < -15%`, `return_252d < -25%`. 0 disagreements → +0.06; 1 → +0.02; 2 → -0.04; 3+ → -0.08. Thresholds are wide so normal V-recovery negativity doesn't trip them. | ± |
| `return_5d < -1.5%` (falling this week) — standalone tactical brake | -0.08 |

Regardless-of-posture:

| Rule                                      | Effect |
|-------------------------------------------|--------|
| `drawdown_current < -0.20` (deep drawdown) | -0.15 |
| `pe_trailing > 60`                         | -0.05 |
| `earnings_yield` in (0, 0.02)              | -0.02 |

After all adjustments: `raw_conviction = clamp(base, 0, 1)`.
If `raw_conviction < 0.40` → posture demoted to `no_edge`.

**Moved out of Layer C as of 2026-04-21** (see `mef_layered_gating.md`):
- Earnings blackout — now Layer A eligibility (5d trend, 10d mean_rev/value).
- Earnings 6–21d penalty/flag zone — now Layer B earnings-proximity hazard (trend only).
- High-impact US macro event — now Layer B macro hazard (4 event types × symbol × engine).
- Negative FCF hard veto — moved out of trend/mean_rev entirely. Retained in Layer C for the **value engine only**, because FCF is the value thesis (cheap + durable).

The raw vs final split means `conviction_score` in the code is now
*final* conviction (after hazard overlay). `raw_conviction` is a new
column on `mef.candidate` carrying the pre-overlay engine belief.
Selectors compare against `conviction_score` / final; the `< 0.40`
posture demotion fires on raw.

**Separation of concerns.** The ranker alone decides whether to emit
and how many. The LLM step (§10) only reviews what the ranker
proposed — it never changes prices, posture, conviction, or the draft
plan. See `mef_llm_gate.md` for prompt details, including the special
rule for pullback setups that prevents the LLM from flagging the
below-current entry zone as a risk_shape issue.

## 7. Recommendation Lifecycle

### 7.1 State machine

```
     proposed ─────► active ────► closed_win
        │              │      ╲─► closed_loss
        │              │      ╲─► closed_timeout
        │              │
        │              └────► closed_timeout  (time-exit reached unfilled inside a scale-in)
        │
        ├─► expired      (entry window closed, never filled)
        └─► dismissed    (CLI: mef dismiss)
```

### 7.2 Transitions

| From | To | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| *(new)* | `proposed` | Emitted by a run |
| `proposed` | `active` | Next `position_snapshot` shows user holds the symbol consistent with the proposed entry |
| `proposed` | `expired` | Entry window end-date < today AND no import has shown the position |
| `proposed` | `dismissed` | `mef dismiss <rec-id>` |
| `active` | `closed_win` / `closed_loss` / `closed_timeout` | See §8 |

Transitions are computed at **every run** (and also at every `mef import-positions`). The state machine is idempotent — running twice produces the same state.

### 7.3 Active-position inference rules

- Match is symbol-level plus a quantity/cost sanity check vs. the proposed entry price. Tunable tolerances (e.g., `quantity >= 50` of proposed size, `entry price within 5% of proposed zone`) live in config.
- A proposed recommendation matches **the first** consistent holdings row that appears after emission.
- If a symbol is already held at proposal time, MEF treats it as an "already held" flag on the recommendation (no auto-activation), so the user isn't surprised by instant activation.

### 7.4 Scoping note on "mine" vs. MEF's tracked set

"Active positions" = symbols MEF has an open recommendation on **and** symbols present in the latest Fidelity import. The two sets can overlap or not:

- Rec emitted + holding shows up → `active` (tracked in both senses)
- Holding exists with no MEF rec → reported in the email as an "other held" position, with read-only status context; MEF does not propose on it unless a new-idea conviction passes the threshold
- Rec emitted, no holding, window passes → `expired`

---

## 8. Scoring

### 8.1 Outcome rule

- `closed_win` — realized round-trip profit at current sell. For short-option expressions (covered call, cash-secured put), option expired OTM → premium kept → win.
- `closed_loss` — realized round-trip loss at current sell, **including** "was up, is now down, sold." Paper gains that reverse before exit are losses.
- `closed_timeout` — time-based exit reached without hitting target or invalidation; realized at that day's close.

### 8.2 Estimated P&L

```
estimated_pnl_100_shares_usd = (exit_price - entry_price) * 100
```

(For short options, use realized premium equivalent; formula tracked separately and documented when that expression ships.)

### 8.3 Benchmark context

For each closed recommendation, record SPY + relevant sector ETF % return over the same calendar window. Do **not** use this to reclassify the outcome; it's supporting context.

### 8.4 Future: real P&L

Once we're comfortable, replace `estimated_pnl_100_shares_usd` with actual realized dollars derived from IRA Guard/PHDB holdings history. v1 stays on the 100-share estimate to avoid PHDB coupling.

---

## 9. Benchmarks

MEF reads benchmark series (SPY + sector ETFs) live from SHDB when computing:

- Evidence (SPY-relative, sector-relative performance)
- Per-closed-recommendation benchmark context

Caching lives in `mef.benchmark_snapshot` **only if** live joins prove too slow. Default path: direct SHDB joins.

---

## 10. LLM Policy

### 10.1 Provider

- **Default:** Claude CLI — invoked as `claude -p <prompt> --model claude-opus-4-7` on the Claude Pro subscription. Default model bumped haiku → **Opus 4.7** on 2026-04-21 to improve stability of the gate's nuanced judgments (see `mef_llm_gate.md`).
- **Pluggable:** a `LLMProvider` interface with `generate(prompt) -> LLMResponse`. Config key `mef.llm.provider` selects which implementation. v1 ships `claude_cli`; an `anthropic_api` or other provider can be dropped in later without touching the ranker.

### 10.2 Role

The LLM is used **only** at step 7 of the pipeline (gate review over ranker survivors) and step 11 (rendered rationale in the email).

Specifically the LLM:

- Judges each ranker survivor with a 3-way disposition (`approve` / `review` / `reject`)
- Produces structured rationale per candidate: `summary`, `strengths[]`, `concerns[]`, `key_judgment`
- Sees the ranker's hazard overlay explicitly (`raw_conviction`, `hazard_penalty_total`, `hazard_flags`) and is instructed not to re-raise already-priced concerns

The LLM does **not**:

- Propose new candidates the ranker didn't
- Change entry / exit / invalidation prices, posture, or conviction
- Produce a cross-candidate ranking or top-pick ordering
- Decide whether "no new trades today" is the right answer (it *can* approve none, but the number of approvals is never constrained)
- Run as part of active-position re-evaluation in v1 (may change later)

### 10.3 Prompt shape (v3, 2026-04-21 rewrite)

The full prompt and its rationale are documented in `mef_llm_gate.md`.
High-level: role framed as a disciplined investment-idea reviewer;
nine review principles emphasizing selectivity, coherence, timing,
and the "good company ≠ good opportunity now" caveat; glossary
defining all six ranker postures (bullish, value_quality,
oversold_bouncing, range_bound, bearish_caution, no_edge); explicit
hazard-already-priced language; JSON-only output with
`reviews[].{summary,strengths,concerns,key_judgment}`.

Prompt template lives in `src/mef/llm/prompts.py :: GATE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`
and is versioned in git. Every prompt text is persisted on
`mef.llm_trace.prompt_text` for diff-vs-outcome analysis.

### 10.4 Logging

Every LLM call is logged to `mef.llm_trace`:

- `llm_uid` (L-…)
- `daily_run_uid`
- `candidate_uid` (nullable — for batch reviews)
- `provider` (e.g., `claude_cli`)
- `model` (captured from the provider's response metadata)
- `prompt_text`, `response_text`
- `elapsed_ms`
- `status` (`ok`, `error`, `timeout`)
- `error_text`

`llm_trace` is append-only. Cost/drift analysis runs off this table.

### 10.5 Failure handling

**Timeout retry.** The Claude CLI occasionally brushes up against the configured subprocess timeout on large prompts (11K+ chars commonly take 60–120s; the slowest successes have hit 115s against a 120s ceiling). `mef.llm.client.call_llm` retries **once** when the first attempt's error is a subprocess timeout: pauses `RETRY_PAUSE_S` (60s), retries at `RETRY_TIMEOUT_S` (180s). Structural errors (binary missing, non-zero exit, unparseable response) are **not** retried — retries don't help them and would double the wall clock on genuine outages. Only the second attempt is written to `mef.llm_trace`; the final error text names both attempts so audit can tell from a single trace row that a retry happened.

**Fallthrough.** If both attempts fail (or a non-timeout error came back on the first try), MEF proceeds with the ranker's output and tags every survivor as `unavailable`. `GateResult.unavailable_kind` classifies the cause (`timeout` / `parse` / `error`) and `unavailable_reason` carries the detail string. Both are written to `ow.mef_event` (code `gate_unavailable`) and drive the email banner text — e.g. "⚠ LLM gate was unavailable for this run **due to LLM timeouts** — ideas below were not reviewed." The run does not fail.

## 11. MEFDB Schema

PostgreSQL 16 on the shared `localhost:5432`. Database `mefdb`, schema `mef`, owner `mef_user`. Credentials in `config/postgres.yaml` (gitignored) with `mefdb` + `shdb` + `overwatch` sections.

## 12. Performance & Concurrency

- Symbol-level work in the daily run (evidence pull, feature compute) is **parallelized** with a small pool. The universe is 320 symbols; a sequential pass is acceptable for v1 but parallelization is the first optimization if a run is too slow.
- Only one run at a time — enforced by a PID file + `ow.mef_lock` row (same dual-lock pattern as MDC / UDC / IRA Guard). A stale lock is auto-cleared when the owning PID is dead.
- LLM calls are the slowest step. Start with a single batch LLM call over all survivors; split only if latency becomes a problem.

---

## 13. Output (Email Rendering)

Two emails per trading day. Rendered as plain text **plus** an HTML part (HTML is a nicety, not required for v1 if it's faster to ship text-only).

Email body layout:

Held for review (J) — LLM flagged these for human attention, not auto-ship:
  1. SYMBOL[:etf] ($price) · medium — posture — expression
     Rec ID:          R-000xxx
     (same block as "New ideas", including the rich Summary/Strengths/
     Concerns/Judgment block — the review items get the same treatment
     as approved ones so the reader has the LLM's full rationale in hand.)
  …

                                                         counted here

Active recommendations & tracked positions (M):
  SYMBOL  rec R-…  state=active  guidance=…
  …

CLI: mef show <rec-id> · mef dismiss <rec-id> · mef status
```

**Symbol header.** `SYMBOL[:etf] ($price) · tier` — the price is the
live Yahoo quote from `mef.price_check` when that ran successfully,
else the SHDB close used at scoring time. The `:etf` tag appears only
on ETF ideas so the reader sees at a glance that a symbol isn't a
single-name trade. `tier` is `high` (conviction ≥ 0.70) or `medium`
(0.50–0.70); the ≥ 0.70 boundary falls into `high`. Omits the price
parenthetical entirely when no price is available.

**Summary block.** Rendered right after the gate banner and before
the macro-events banner (skipped on staleness-aborted runs). Counts
what the email actually contains, not the universe: the final-list
tier split, how many picks were cross-engine confirmations
(`len(source_engines) > 1`) vs single-engine, and the held-for-review
count. Designed for a 10-second glance — the block answers "what did
MEF actually recommend today, and how many did it hold back?" before
the reader scrolls into details.

**Rec ID line.** Every idea prints its `R-0000xx` so the closing CLI
hint (`mef show <rec-id>`) is directly actionable from the email.

**Plan line.** One plain-English sentence restating the levels + hold
horizon, rendered right after Rec ID so it sits where the eye lands
after the symbol header. Shape depends on the expression:

- Buy variants: `"Buy under $X, sell near $Y, cut at $Z. Hold up to N days."`
- Pullback variant (`needs_pullback=True`): `"Wait for a dip to $X, then buy. Sell near $Y, cut at $Z. Hold up to N days."`
- Premium variants (cash-secured put / covered call): `"Sell a cash-secured put at $LOW-$HIGH. Close if SYM drops below $Z. N-day expiry."`

Prices round to whole dollars — the Plan line is a skim-friendly
restatement, so the full precision lives in the numeric k/v block
below. Deterministic: all inputs are already on the idea dict
(`entry_zone`, `stop`, `target`, `time_exit`, `needs_pullback`,
`expression`, `symbol`) — no LLM call. Silently omitted when those
fields are missing.

**Rich LLM block.** Added 2026-04-21 alongside the prompt v3 rewrite.
Replaces the old single-line `Reasoning:` for ideas that went through
the gate. Four fields from the LLM's structured output:

- `Summary:` — 1–2 sentence rationale for the decision
- `Strengths:` — up to 2 bullets describing what supports the case
- `Concerns:` — up to 2 bullets describing what weakens the case
- `Judgment:` — one-sentence bottom line: why this deserves action now

Bullet caps are enforced on the render side (prompt permits 3, email
shows 2) so each idea stays skim-friendly. Same block renders in both
"New ideas" (approved) and "Held for review" — concerns are useful
context even on an approved idea. When the LLM was unavailable or a
historical rec predates the rich-output schema, the render falls back
to a single-line `Reasoning:` drawn from the legacy
`recommendation.reasoning_summary`.

**Price check line.** The post-emission price-freshness check
(`mef.price_check`, see `mef_price_check.md`) fetches a live Yahoo
quote for each emitted idea and classifies the delta vs the SHDB close
used at scoring time. Renders on its own line only when the tier is
`info` (1–3% move) or `warn` (≥3% move, prefixed with ⚠). Silent
when the move is inside 1% or when the fetch failed.

**Pullback annotation** (`⏳ wait for pullback (currently ~$X)`)
fires when the candidate's `needs_pullback` flag is set (stock at/near
its recent peak). The entry zone on the same line is a pullback-
anchored resting-limit price below current — it fills on a dip or it
doesn't.

**Earnings annotation** (`📅 earnings in Nd`) appears on the symbol
line when the candidate's `next_earnings_date` is within 21 days.
Earnings within the Layer-A blackout window never reach the email —
Layer A blocks the symbol per engine (trend 5d, mean_rev 10d, value
10d; see `mef_layered_gating.md`). By the time an idea hits the email
the annotation is context, not a warning. The 6–21d window on trend
setups also gets a Layer B earnings-proximity hazard penalty applied
upstream.

**Gate-unavailable banner** is appended to the header block when the
LLM gate failed wholesale — with a suffix naming the failure class:
"⚠ LLM gate was unavailable for this run **due to LLM timeouts** —
ideas below were not reviewed." The per-idea block carries a
"⚠ Not reviewed by LLM (gate unavailable)." footer when the gate
returned that specific candidate as `unavailable`.

The macro banner (`📅 Upcoming high-impact US macro events`) is
rendered only when the bundle carries events within a 3-day horizon.
Quiet days produce no banner.

The "Held for review" section carries the full setup (entry / stop /
target / R:R) plus the LLM's one-sentence reason so the reader can
judge whether to act manually without running `mef show`. Rejected
ideas do not appear in the email; they're MEFDB-only and surface via
`mef rejections`.

Subject line differs between runs (`pre-market` vs `post-market`). The "no new trades today" case still sends a complete email with an empty New-ideas section — MEF never skips a scheduled email.

Delivery: `notify.py --source MEF --to <configured-email>`. No SMS, no other channels.

## 14. Telemetry

Fail-silent writes to the `overwatch` database:

- `ow.mef_run` — one row per run: `run_uid`, `when_kind`, `intent`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `status`, `symbols_evaluated`, `recommendations_emitted`, `email_sent`, `error_text`.
- `ow.mef_event` — discrete events: `event_uid`, `run_uid`, `severity` (`info` / `warning` / `error`), `code`, `message`, `created_at`.

Never block an email or a run because telemetry is down.

Dashboards:

- **MEF — Runs:** last runs, status, duration, ideas emitted, emails sent
- **MEF — Recommendations:** active count, win/loss/timeout over time, P&L histogram
- **MEF — LLM:** call volume, latency, failures (from `mef.llm_trace`)

Dashboards come after the first real runs exist; don't build them up front.

## 17. Testing Priorities

Pure-logic tests first:

- Ranker: given a fixed feature set, expected posture and score
- Lifecycle: every valid state transition, idempotency of re-runs
- Active-position inference: varying overlap of holdings and proposed entries
- Scoring: win/loss/timeout classification and estimated-P&L math
- Email rendering: new-ideas list empty / single / many; active-position formatting
- Expiration: entry window past → `expired` exactly once

DB-backed tests against a scratch MEFDB:

- Universe load idempotency
- Full-pipeline smoke test with a tiny stub SHDB dataset
- Lock behavior (two concurrent runs contending)

Real CLI tests:

- `mef run --when premarket` end-to-end on a dev schema
- `mef dismiss` / `mef import-positions` / `mef show` against real rows

`pytest -q` runs fast; add tests for new pure logic as it lands.

---

## 18. Open Decisions (to settle during implementation)

- Exact SHDB earnings-calendar table (confirm during v1 build).
- Long-option outcome scoring when/if long-premium expressions become in-scope.
- Email format: plain-text only v1, or HTML v1?
- Whether `mef.benchmark_snapshot` is built up front or added only on performance grounds.
- Cron times for pre-market / post-market after checking MDC/UDC schedules to avoid contention.
- Whether to standardize the LLM prompt as a versioned file (`prompts/v1.txt`) or a Python constant.

Nothing in this list blocks the build; each resolves at the natural point in the build order.

---

## 19. Non-Standard Choices Worth Calling Out

- **MEF maintains its own `position_snapshot` rather than reading PHDB.** Chosen for independence from IRA Guard's DB; if the tools are ever merged or share an ingest step, this is an easy refactor.
- **LLM review produces the `reasoning_summary` that ships in the email.** If the LLM is unavailable, the recommendation still ships with the deterministic plan but a placeholder reasoning field.
- **"No new trades today" is a real email body.** MEF never suppresses an email just because nothing happened.
- **Short-option OTM expiration = win.** Stated explicitly because the raw design note is ambiguous on long vs. short options; v1 only emits short-option expressions, so this is consistent.
- **Scoring starts at 100-share P&L estimate.** Real P&L via PHDB is explicitly a v2 concern.

---

## 20. Minimum Path to "Working for Testing"

The smallest thing worth calling v1:

1. `mef status` returns.
2. `mef universe load` populates the 305+15.
3. `mef import-positions` ingests a real Fidelity CSV.
4. `mef run --when postmarket` runs end-to-end against SHDB with a crude ranker, produces zero-or-more recommendations, logs an LLM trace, and sends a real email.
5. `mef dismiss <rec-id>` works. Expiration and auto-activation work on the next run.
6. `mef score` runs over whatever has closed.
7. Two cron entries fire pre- and post-market on weekdays.

Everything else — prompt tuning, richer evidence, better email, DAS/RSE integration, web UI — is iteration on top of that base.
